    and give to chemparse to parse it into its constituents and return it as a dictionary.
    Then we put these chemicals into compounds dictionary where keys are chemical formula and values are dictionaries containing its constituents and their corresponding quantity
    Elements dictionary which contains indices of elements is also constructed and returned
    In the latest update (April 16, 2024), variable annotation can include the composition of the compound which is given by its name to CellML: 
    'va_mekppmapk-mek.mapk': This annotation containes two parts separated by an underline(_). 2nd part contains the compound name and its composition. The minus sign(-) separates component name and composition.
    So the first part (mekppmapk) is the component name. The 2nd part (mek.mapk) shows that it is composed of 'mek' and 'mapk'.
